Creating a modal window using JavaScript

First week into my journey to learn JavaScript. Starting to build some web functionalities by manipulating the DOM. This modal window let us open it from 
3 different buttons and close the modal window via 3 ways : the exit button, the Esc key, and a click outside of the modal window.

always try to dry up the lines of code to the most simplistic yet effective functions.
